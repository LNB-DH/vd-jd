This directory contains Python scripts that run various transliteration models.

## Running Scripts

### Running Locally

To run scripts locally you need to install required dependencies found at requirements.txt in the root of the repository.

Note: It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for this. Then you can install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

More on virtual environments can be found [Python Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
